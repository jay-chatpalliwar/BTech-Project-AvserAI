About Sybill:
(http://sybill.ai/)
At Sybill.ai (https://www.sybill.ai/), we are building a 10x better way to do B2B sales via an end-to-end, AI-first GTM stack that unlocks unprecedented levels of automation for the sales reps. The existing GTM stack only gives reps a better UX to do their admin tasks. With Sybill, reps will not need to do them at all. All they will need to do is take customer calls and supervise the AI, enabling them to be super-sellers.
Our founding team from Stanford, Harvard and IITs has built a sales-specific, proprietary AI to extract highly accurate deal attributes, which unlocks these workflows. This AI-first GTM stack will disrupt both today's pigeonholed tools (Gong, Highspot, Scratchpad, Clari, Outreach) and remove the need for extensive middle management in GTM orgs.
With Sybill's conversational AI workflows, reps are seeing a remarkable behavior switch in their day-to-day and they just can't stop using the product (gross retention - 99%+). They are vocal about their love for Sybill on LinkedIn, enabling us to grow 20x to $1.2M in ARR last year.

As a senior member of our team, you will play a crucial role in leading the development of key features while working closely with the product, engineering, and customer teams.
Responsibilities:
Lead the development and deployment of Generative AI-based features for Sybill's AI agents.
Collaborate with product, engineering, and customer teams to design, build, and improve AI models tailored to specific enterprise use cases
Developing a keen ability to condition (prompt, finetune, chat with) LLMs and understand how to produce the best output from them
Staying on top of emerging trends in LLMs to enhance individual efficiency and further build Sybill's product
Requirements:
Experience with Generative AI and large language models, such as BERT, GPT, or Transformers
Strong programming skills, with experience in Python and AI libraries
Proven track record of ideation, designing, productionizing, and deploying AI models at scale
2-5 years of experience with building and deploying AI applications
Experience with analyzing and understanding data and experimenting/iterating with ML models
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to work independently and as part of a team
Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science or a related field

Compensation and Benefits:
The opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI technologies and help solve real-world customer problems.
Close collaboration with a talented and diverse team, learning from accomplished experts in the field.
A flexible and supportive work environment, encouraging personal and professional growth.
Competitive compensation package, including equity and comprehensive benefits (Compensation Range: $150K - $200K)

We make school awesome everyday for students and the people supporting them by finding out what they need and making it happen.
Values
We want everyone at SchoolAI to make a competitive wage, have fun, and do good. As we build out the team, we optimize for, and invest in, great people who:
Make Magic: You're making magic when you dream big, sweat the details, make the complex look elegant, and the final result is one that puts a smile on everyone's face. People are drawn to working with you and your work.
️ Rise to the Moment: You're rising to the moment when you show up, answer the call, make the extra effort, and appreciate the fact that we are working with the coolest technology, in the biggest space it’ll impact, and we’re in pole position.

Connect the Dots: You've done the work to prioritize, understand, and tie your work to your team, to students, and to the people who support them. You're driving tangible outcomes and can connect your work to meaningful, tangible business results and goals. You're connecting the dots when you've thought deeply and have a throughline narrative for your work.
Make High Leverage Bets: Always consider the board in front of you – using data, instinct, honed expertise, and user problems to pick the best move and maximize the impact of every resource. When the moment is right – go all in.
➡️ Simplify and Go: Cut through the noise. Focus on what’s essential and act with urgency. Speed is your ally, simplicity your tool. Embrace clarity and let it guide you to swift victories.
We use our core values to make decisions, evaluate work, and win. We expect that every team member demonstrate these values. In turn, we'll invest in you and your impact at SchoolAI.

Key ML focus areas:
Unsupervised machine learning techniques such as:
Text clustering and topic modeling
Intent and sentiment extraction
Entity resolution
Modern NLP techniques
Knowledge Graphs and Graph Neural Networks
LLM finetuning
Data engineering and statistical data modeling
Distributed, scalable, model inference
What you’ll do at SchoolAI:
Using massive amounts of historical and realtime conversational data, you will develop, train, automate, and deploy LLMs and other models for semantic understanding, text similarities, clustering, classification, emotion detection, and expressive summarization
You'll build composable, hierarchical, graph-based agentic RAG systems
Work with product management and design roles to understand and empathize with end customer needs
Build end-to-end ML solutions spanning from data access (SQL) to model endpoint (API / batch service) and deploy to cloud based staging environments by collaborating with software engineers
Research, experiment, and deploy new ML methods to enhance our products
We'd love to hear from you if you:
Have 3-5 experience in developing, training, and deploying ML solutions such as LLM-based agent systems, semantic search, or recommendation engines
Have some relevant ML experience related to semantic understanding, text similarities, clustering, classification, emotion detection, and expressive summarization
Have a working understanding of domain driven design and decentralized decoupled software architectures
Lean toward action and experimentation with a priority towards rapid prototyping
Approach problems from a first principles mindset and question assumptions
Are naturally curious and willing to take a step to learn something new and you don’t always revert to solving problems the same way you’ve solved problems in the past
Have experience with SQL, Python, NLTK or Spacy or other NLP libraries, PyTorch or JAX or TensorFlow.
We don't expect you to be an accelerated compute engineer, but exposure to networked, multi-rank GPUs is a huge bonus
DGL and data visualization experience is a plus
