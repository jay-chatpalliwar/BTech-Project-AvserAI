Who we are:
Today, when you go to your doctor and need to be referred to a specialist (e.g., for sleep apnea), your doctor sends a fax (yes, in 2024, 90% of provider-provider communication is a 1980s fax). These are often converted into 20+ page PDFs, with handwritten (doctor’s handwriting!) notes, in thousands of different formats.
Tennr built RaeLM (7B—trained on 3M+ documents) to read these docs, talk to your doc to ensure nothing is missed, and help schedule your appointment so you can get better, faster.
We are an NYC-based tech company that launched out of Y-Combinator, backed by Andreesen Horowitz, Foundation Capital, The New Normal Fund, and other top investors.
Tennr is scaling fast. We need somebody to enable our product engineering team’s rapid expansion into new product lines while preparing for the demands of higher usage, stringent compliance, robust safety checks, and interfacing with highly complex architectures.
Who you are:
To solve this patient processing problem plaguing the US healthcare system, we’ve had to develop state-of-the-art, custom document reading models. We’ve made incredible progress, but still have more work to do.
In the heavily regulated healthcare industry, we’re operating under different constraints than your typical software company.
It is imperative that you are creative and can grapple with compliance while enabling the team to build with the same speed and techniques that are standard in world-class product organizations, but haven’t become the norm in healthcare.
We need to ensure that we’re building our infrastructure on rock solid foundations to prepare for an order of magnitude increase in usage over the next year, while acting as a core service for providers.
This is an extremely cross-functional, high impact role. You will be working closely with our Front End, Infrastructure, Backend, and Integrations Engineering teams as well as our CX and Product teams.
Responsibilities:
Build automations to ensure secure product releases. Ensure smooth production-grade execution of solutions
Own and build out all DevOps function: infrastructure, cloud environment, tools, services, architecture, and uptime
Build interfaces for product engineers to leverage infrastructure and data securely while building at speed
Ensure meticulous adherence to strict healthcare compliance requirements
Implement new cloud technologies and open-source tools
Plan and manage rapid data capacity growth across our product offering
Requirements:
7+ years of experience as a DevOps engineer on high-scale distributed systems
Strong understanding of SOC-2, HIPAA, and ISO/IEC 27001 compliance measures
Extensive knowledge of AWS environments and their security services
Hands-on experience with containerized environments
Docker and Kubernetes are a must
Strong automation mindset and sense of ownership
In-depth knowledge of build/release systems and CI/CD pipelines

About HockeyStack
HockeyStack helps B2B companies drive more revenue.

We're revolutionizing how marketing and sales teams leverage data and uncover insights from it. Our cutting-edge data platform unifies and transforms data from CRMs, ad platforms, and websites in real-time, extracting actionable insights to drive revenue.

Every B2B company grapples with this challenge. If you've ever seen sales and marketing teams struggling to find effective strategies, you understand the problem we're solving. Join us in our mission to make good companies great.

We graduated from YC’s Summer 23 batch and we've roughly doubled our ARR every 6 months since then. If you join, you'll be part of a high-growth startup with proven product-market fit, methodically building a billion-dollar company through a high-performance culture and exceptional talent.

What we value
Builders.
Coding well is a rigorous craft. We are looking for people who enjoy coding just for the sake of it. That’s how you build really cool stuff.
Ownership.
Expect to own a crucial part of the product within your first two weeks. No jokes. We’ve seen that only the ones who can take this kind of a responsibility can thrive in this environment.
Shipping. Fast.
You don’t need to break things to move fast. But you do need a certain kind of mentality to know what shortcuts you can take and what tradeoffs you can make. How else can you grow fast if you aren’t deploying to prod every day?
Scalability.
Writing production-ready code is a very different thing when you have 1 customer versus over 100. You should take pride in thinking through every line of code you write and any edge cases it might introduce.

Fun Facts
Some of our SQL queries involve more than 500 lines of code.
We are munging and managing more than 60TB of data for our customers
We process high-throughput data from 30+ data sources

About the role
Who were looking for
You might call yourself a platform engineer, an SRE, or just an empathetic developer. You enjoy building the infrastructure around which other fellow engineers can code and spend time thinking about how things scale.
What you will be doing
The one-liner is that you are operating the development team behind the scenes.

You’ll primarily work on our AWS servers and infrastructure, get familiar with the Node.js backend and the Next.js frontend as well as the MongoDB and ClickHouse databases. You will be tasked with setting up the code deployments through Github Actions and also manage our Grafana/Prometheus setup.

You will be our silent guardian. A watchful protector. Not a dark knight but close enough… You’ll code just like everyone else but your responsibilities lie beyond the code itself - on how it interacts with the infrastructure.
Requirements:
San Francisco, in person every day
Good backend knowledge (Node.js)
Great AWS experience (EC2, S3, EKS etc.)
Sufficient knowledge around observability
Composure even during the wildest fires
Ready to work really hard on really hard problems
Bonus Points:
High-growth SaaS experience, including scalability challenges

Benefits:
Some of the cool benefits we offer aside from the cool technical work you get to do alongside some smart engineers:
TOP salary + meaningful equity
Beautiful office near South Park in SF
Gourmet catered daily meals from a chef
Unlimited Beer & diet coke (because who likes coke zero :d)
